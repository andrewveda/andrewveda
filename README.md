## 🧑‍🏫 **About Me**
Assistant Professor of English who treats learning as the highest form of self-creation.  
A chess player who brings the game's logic and clarity into the communication classroom, guiding students to think boldly and express themselves with confidence and purpose.

I am passionate about gamifying learning so students fall in love with learning through curiosity.  
Everything I do is aimed at instilling in them the desire to become the best version of who they can be.
