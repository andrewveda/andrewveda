Assistant Professor of English at SRM Valliammai Engineering College who treats learning as the highest form of self-creation. A chess player who brings the game’s logic and clarity into the communication classroom, guiding students to think boldly and express themselves with confidence and purpose. I am passionate about gamifying the learning journey so students fall in love with learning through curiosity. Everything I do is aimed at instilling in them the desire to become the best version of who they can be.
My personal motto: “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”
